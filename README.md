üîë Key Components:

Importing the Library:
Utilized the Listener class from the pynput.keyboard module to monitor keyboard events.

Defining the Log File:
Created a log file (keylog.txt) to store the captured keystrokes.

Key Press Handling:
Developed the on_press function to handle key press events. This function opens the log file in append mode and writes the pressed keys to it.

Setting Up the Listener:
Set up a listener to monitor keystrokes and invoke the on_press function whenever a key is pressed. The listener runs continuously, awaiting keypress events.

üõ† How to Use:
Clone or download the repository.
Install the pynput library using pip install pynput.
Run the script using python keylogger.py.
Check keylog.txt for the recorded keystrokes.
